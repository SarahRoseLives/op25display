# OP25Display App

The OP25Display App is a small section of a larger application intended to turn OP25 into a full fledged mobile scanner. That is NOT what this is. This is simply a Display application that allows you enter the URL to your OP25 instance's web server and you'll get a pretty display that let's you see what talk group is talking and on which system.

There is some place holder text but this is pretty much it.

If you're interested in seeing the application this is based on head over to: [SarahRoseLives/remotecontrolhead](https://github.com/SarahRoseLives/remotecontrolhead).
